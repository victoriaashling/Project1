# Knocked Up

This is a game built in javascript with the phaser.io library. It uses Google's firebase to store user data and Google and Facebook APIs to login users in. This was a group project -- I was responsible for the intial intro flow, taking users from the main welcome screen, through the login process, and on to play the game. I integrated the login and styled the CSS backgrounds and javascript animations.
